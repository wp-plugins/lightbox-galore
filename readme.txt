No frills lightbox effect for images.

== Description ==

No frills lightbox effect when clicking images tagged with rel="lightbox". 

Also supports the older convention when the rel="lightbox" tag is a property of an enclosing &lt;a href&gt; tag.

Click the lightbox or press &lt;esc&gt; to close it.

Lightbox shows images as-is with real width and height, so make sure they are uploaded to the server save with the width and height they are supposed to be seen.

Example: 

&lt;img src="[url to image]" rel="lightbox" width="[an integer]" /&gt;

..or..

&lt;a href="[url to image]" rel="lightbox"&gt;&lt;img src="[url to image]" width="[an integer]" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
