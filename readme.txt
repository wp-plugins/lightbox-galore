No frills lightbox effect when clicking images tagged with rel="lightbox". Also works when the rel="lightbox" tag is a property of en enclosing <a href> tag.

== Description ==

No frills lightbox effect when clicking images tagged with rel="lightbox". 

Also supports the older convention when the rel="lightbox" tag is a property of an enclosing <a href> tag.

Click the lightbox or press <esc> to close it.

Lightbox shows images as-is with real width and height, so make sure they are uploaded to the server save with the width and height they are supposed to be seen.

Example: 

<img src="[url to image]" rel="lightbox" width="[an integer]" /></a>

..or..

<a href="[url to image]" rel="lightbox"><img src="[url to image]" width="[an integer]" /></a>
